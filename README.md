# Linguisto
This application is being made as a part of Major Project, IT (MSIT) 

Our application has two modes: Learn and Quiz. The first mode concentrates on learning the language through graphics and sound. It will enable people to understand the meaning of the word as well as learn its pronunciation. We will be using various learning techniques so that the user picks up the language quickly like fill in the blanks, writing the meaning of the word displayed and using the word in a sentence. The second mode is to test the knowledge of the user gained through the leaning mode. A score card will also be available where the user can check his proficiency and progress of the language.
